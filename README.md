# Practical Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for Stock Trading


## Prerequisites
Python 3.6 envrionment

## Step 1: Install OpenAI Baselines System Packages [OpenAI Instruction](https://github.com/openai/baselines)
### Ubuntu
```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install cmake libopenmpi-dev python3-dev zlib1g-dev
```
### Mac OS X
Installation of system packages on Mac requires [Homebrew](https://brew.sh). With Homebrew installed, run the following:
```bash
brew install cmake openmpi
```


## Step 2: Create and Activate Virtual Environment
```bash
pip install virtualenv
```
Virtualenvs are essentially folders that have copies of python executable and all python packages.
To create a virtualenv called venv with python3, one runs
```bash
virtualenv -p python3 venv
```
To activate a virtualenv:
```
source venv/bin/activate
```


## Step 3: Install openAI gym environment under this virtual environment: venv
#### Tensorflow versions
The master branch supports Tensorflow from version 1.4 to 1.14. For Tensorflow 2.0 support, please use tf2 branch. Refer to [TensorFlow installation guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/)
for more details.
- Install gym and tensorflow packages:
    ```bash
    pip install gym
    pip install gym[atari]Â 
    pip install tensorflow==1.14
    ```
- Other packages that might be missing:
    ```bash
    pip install filelock
    pip install matplotlib
    pip install pandas
    ```
## Step 4: Download and Install Official Baseline Package
- Clone the repo and cd into it:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/openai/baselines.git
    cd baselines
    ```

- Install baselines package
    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```

## Step 5: Testing the installation
All unit tests in baselines can be run using pytest runner:
```
pip install pytest
pytest
```
All unit tests have to get passed, in the end you will see something like: 94 passed, 49 skipped, 72 warnings in 355.29s. If there are any errors or failed tests, you have to debug it using stackoverflow to make sure all unit tests passed in the end.

## Replace files with files in this repository and change file address

### gym
Find your gym package under environment folder, in my computer it is under
```bash
/Users/xiongzhuoran/anaconda3/envs/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/gym/
```
- Replece the file
```bash
gym\envs\__init__.py
```
with file from this repository
```bash
DQN_Stock_Trading/gym/envs/__init__.py
```

- Add folder in this repository to gym\envs in your computer
```bash
DQN_Stock_Trading/gym/envs/zxstock of this repository
```

- Open
```bash
gym/envs/zxstock/zxstock_env.py and gym/envs/zxstock/zxstock_testenv.py
```
change the address at line 9 and line 10 into where you want to save the image

### Baseline
- Open your baselines folder cloned before, find
```bash
baselines/baselines/run.py
```

- Replace it with
```bash
DQN_Stock_Trading/baselines/baselines/run.py in this reposotory
```

## Training model and Testing
If you only want to train the model run this
```bash
python -m baselines.run --alg=ddpg --env=ZXStock-v0 --network=mlp --num_timesteps=1e4
```

If you also want to see the testing result
```bash
python -m baselines.run --alg=ddpg --env=ZXStock-v0 --network=mlp --num_timesteps=1e4 --play
```



### Some Other Commands May Need:
Tensorflow Update
```bash
pip install --upgrade tensorflow==1.11.0
```
```bash
pip3 install opencv-python
pip3 install lockfile
pip3 install -U numpy
pip3 install mujoco-py==0.5.7
```
